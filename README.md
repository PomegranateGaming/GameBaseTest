# GameBase(Test)
This is a test for the Game Base.
The test is now also the official Pomegranate Gaming Game Base.
Here are the instructions for using the game base:
- Use config.js to make the code needed for the project to run
- Use game.js to define variables right under the comment.
- Build with GH pages.
